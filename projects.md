> _Computer Vision_

<!-- <br> -->

#### 1. AutoNet

**_"Neural architecture search for CNN, SaaS."_**

Conceptualized and implemented a microservices-based architecture to search and train a CNN model for uploaded images using the “DARTS: Differential Architecture Search” algorithm to search for a CNN model. Developed various components of the architecture performing intercommunication using Kafka.

#### 2. Stereo Depth Estimation

**_"Estimate depth from stereo images"_**

Evaluated the effectiveness of multiple stereo depth estimation algorithms on an unstructured stereo vision for autonomous driving on data collected from the real-world(Apolloscape) and Carla.

#### 3. Autonomous Car: Bosch Future Mobility Challenge 2022

**_"1/10th scale level 2.5 autonomous car"_**

Developed an autonomous driving car capable of navigating in a miniature smart city, performing manoeuvres such as lane-keeping, following traffic signs and traffic lights, intersection navigation, overtaking, and parking. Secured 11th rank globally among 52 teams in Bosch Future Mobility Challenge held in Romania.

#### 4. Distributed City Surveillance

**_"Detect guns and knives in public places"_**

Created a location sourcing platform for security bodies, used for sourcing unsafe locations by collecting data from a mobile app and an AI application that detect guns and knives.

#### 5. Autonomous Greenhouse Control

**_"Control greenhouse parameter using RL."_**

Created an autonomous control system based on reinforcement learning for controlling greenhouses as a web application deployed on AWS. Used multiple technologies such as Tensorflow, AWS, FastAPI, Dash Python, and Tableau. Contributed by building the RL model, backend API, and cloud architecture for the project on AWS. Published in [“Deep Reinforcement Learning for Agriculture: Principles and Use Cases”](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-16-5847-1_4).
