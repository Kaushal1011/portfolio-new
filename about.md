## About Me

I’m Kaushal, a Master's student in Computer Science at UIC. I love to code, create music, and design. Over the years, I’ve tackled diverse software projects, building backend systems and distributed architectures using technologies like Python, JavaScript, and Scala. I don’t confine myself to one role—I’m a builder, always eager to explore new technologies.

I’m passionate about AI and Distributed Systems. I’ve built various projects that solve interesting problems. Check out my projects.

I also co-founded getriff.xyz in 2022, where I explored the integration of AI with Web3, improving user security and blockchain accessibility. Our work involved extracting on-chain data and creating smart contract queries from legacy systems through magic links. My goal was to generate actionable insights and detect fraudulent transactions before they were approved by users.

Currently, I’m a Graduate Research Assistant at UIC’s Center for Clinical and Translational Science. I work as a full-stack Django developer on the ADRESai project, building a smart data availability and query platform for medical research data. My work involves creating new features, optimizing queries, building APIs, and integrating new data sources. I’m also solving challenges like asynchronous job scheduling in Django and SQL Generation via ontology tree traversals.

Let’s connect and build something impactful together!
