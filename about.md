## About Me

I am Kaushal, a Masters in Computer Science student at UIC. I like to code, make music and design stuff. I take up new projects every now and then to explore new sets of technologies. I have no fixed roles, but you could say that I am a builder. I professionally work on multiple software development projects daily, usually on the backend side. I have experience developing for systems with advanced system architecture.

I am interested in researching artificial intelligence and Big Data. I have created several projects academically and open source that solve daily problems using various machine learning and deep learing approaches and I am currently building a new product that leverages AI technology to make blockchain transactions safer. [Check out my projects](https://www.kaushalpatil.me/projects).

I co-founded [getriff.xyz](https://getriff.xyz), where I worked on applications of AI to improve user security on blockchain and integrating Web3 with legacy solutions. I explored ways of extracting on-chain data and making smart contracts queryable from non-browser and legacy systems by creating safe magic links. I wanted to generate actionable insights for our users from blockchain data and detect fraudulent transactions before our users approve. 

Currently I am working as graduate research assitant at UIC's center for clinical and translational science. I work as a full stack djano developer. I am working on ADRESai project building smart data availability, query  platform for medical data queries requested by researchers. My role invloves creating new features, optimising queries in django, creating new APIs and integrating new data sources. Currently, I am trying to solve asynchronous job scheduling problem in django.
