## About Me

I am Kaushal, a recent computer science graduate passionate about building. I like to code, make music and design stuff. I take up new projects every now and then to explore new sets of technologies. I have no fixed roles, but you could say that I am a builder. I professionally work on multiple software development projects daily, usually on the backend side. I have experience developing for systems with advanced system architecture.

I am interested in researching artificial intelligence. I have created several projects academically and open source that solve daily problems using various machine learning and deep learing approaches and I am currently building a new product that leverages AI technology to make blockchain transactions safer. [Check out my projects](https://www.kaushalpatil.me/projects).

I am a co-founder at [getriff.xyz](https://getriff.xyz), working on applications of AI to improve user security on blockchain and integrating Web3 with legacy solutions. I am exploring ways of extracting on-chain data and making smart contracts queryable from non-browser and legacy systems by creating safe magic links. I want to generate actionable insights for our users from blockchain data and detect fraudulent transactions before our users approve. We are a sister company of Pedals Up, where I contribute as a software development engineer 2.
